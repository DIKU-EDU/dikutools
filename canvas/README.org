* Get All Students

#+BEGIN_SRC
https://absalon.ku.dk/api/v1/courses/:course_id/sections?include=students
#+END_SRC

This returns a JSON object containing all sections, with the students in them.
If you're one of those courses that lumps all students into one section, you're
in luck, just grab those in "Hold 01", else you'll have to do some
combinatorics.

This includes their names and KU e-mails. Beware, students now have _mixed_
=@ku.dk= and =@absalon.ku.dk= e-mail addresses.

For more, see the Canvas API on
[[https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/sections.html#method.sections.index][listing
course sections]].
