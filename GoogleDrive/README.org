#+TITLE: Google Drive Upload

Uploads the given, *uniquely named* file to Google Drive.

Useful for sharing exam-number-named files via Google Drive with external
examiners. That is, if you feel resentful of automatic sync.

* Usage

From the command-line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./upload.py filepath1
$ ./upload.py filepath2
$ ./upload.py filepath3
#+END_SRC

However, you will have to point-and-click in your web-browser on each
instanciation of the script, so you might find it nicer to work with a Python
prompt instead:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
>>> import upload
>>> drive = upload.login()
# Point-and-click in the freshly-spawned browser window.
>>> upload.tryUpload(drive, filepath1) # Returns 0 on success.
>>> upload.tryUpload(drive, filepath2) # Returns 0 on success.
>>> upload.tryUpload(drive, filepath3) # Returns 0 on success.
#+END_SRC
