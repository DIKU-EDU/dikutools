#+TITLE: Google Drive Upload

Uploads the given uniquely named file to Google Drive.

Useful if sharing e.g. exam-number-named files via Google Drive with the
external examiners. That is, if you feel resentful of automatic sync.

Usage: ~./upload.py <very-good-student.txt>~

Or from within Python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import upload
drive = upload.login()
upload.tryUpload(drive, filepath)
#+END_SRC

Requires: PyDrive (~sudo pip3 install pydrive~)

You will also need some credentials:
