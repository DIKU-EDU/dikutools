#+TITLE: Google Drive Upload

Uploads the given uniquely named file to Google Drive.

Useful for sharing exam-number-named files via Google Drive with external
examiners. That is, if you feel resentful of automatic sync.

Usage: ~./upload.py <very-good-student.txt>~

NB! You will have to point and click in your web-browser as the script asks for
your credentials.

Or from within Python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import upload
drive = upload.login()
# Point-and-click in the freshly-spawned browser window.
upload.tryUpload(drive, filepath1)
upload.tryUpload(drive, filepath2)
upload.tryUpload(drive, filepath3)
# ...
#+END_SRC

Requires: PyDrive (~sudo pip install pydrive~)

You will also

credentials]].
