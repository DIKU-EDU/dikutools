To make it easier for you to get started with the tools that you need for this
course, we've set up a VirtualBox image with all the tools that you will need.
Follow this guide to get started with the VirtualBox image.

== The VirtualBox Image

https://www.virtualbox.org/[Oracle VM VirtualBox] is a free software that can
create, run, and monitor virtual machines (VMs). This sort of software is
typically called a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor[hypervisor]. Go
ahead and https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads#VirtualBoxbinaries[install
VirtualBox on your host operating system].

[IMPORTANT]
.Enable Hardware Virtualization
====

On most systems, "hardware virtualization" must first be enabled in the
BIOS/UEFI configurations before VirtualBox can run effectively. Restart your
computer, enter the BIOS/UEFI. Enable the "hardware virtualization" feature for
your CPU. (This features is called VT-x on Intel, and AMD-V on AMD systems.)

====

We have prepared https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format[Open
Virtual Appliance (OVA)] which you can _import_ in your VirtualBox.

Use one of the following mirrors to download the appliance:

* http://napoleon.hiperfit.dk/~oleks/compsys16/
* http://harlem.dikurevy.dk/~oleks/compsys16/

[TIP]
.Checksums
====

A checksum is an almost unique alphanumeric code generated based on the
contents of a file. A checksum is often used to check the integrity of a file.

It is important to check the checksum the files you download over an insecure
network (such as http), and from otherwise untrusted services. This gives you
more confidence that you got what you intended.

The SHA256 checksums are:

* 32-bit: `4eae1eeede356ca21951153c5af1ae06f289de033f6c5c3bfee6a3d47a031a04`
* 64-bit: `4eae1eeede356ca21951153c5af1ae06f289de033f6c5c3bfee6a3d47a031a04`

On Linux/OS X you can use the program `sha256sum`:

----
$ sha25sum <file>.ova
----

On Windows, you can use `certUtil`:

----
> certUtil -hashfile <file>.ova SHA256
----

====

Once you have a good-looking OVA-file, and have VirtualBox
installed, you can either use the GUI:

. Open up VirtualBox and choose File â†’ Import Appliance.
. Choose a virtual appliance to import: your OVA-file.
. Press "Next" and "Import".

You now have a virtual image `<file>` in your left-hand sidebar. Select it,
hold down Shift, and press "Start". This will start it in "headless" mode.

We suggest working headless with this VM. We will use SSH to log into the box
as one would log in on a server over the Internet.

_Or_ you can use the command-line:

----
VBoxManage import <file>.ova
VBoxManage startvm <file> --type headless
----

[TIP]
.Windows PATH
====

On Windows, you will need to add `C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox` to you
`PATH` Environment Variable before you can frivolously use `VBoxManage` from
the command-line.

====

[TIP]
.Trouble starting the virtual machine? The virtual machine is sloooow?
====

If you are getting a warning like:

____
VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration is not available on your system.
____

You need to enable "hardware virtualization" in your BIOS/UEFI configurations.
Restart your computer, enter the BIOS/UEFI. Enable the "hardware
virtualization" feature for your CPU. (This features is called VT-x on Intel,
and AMD-V on AMD systems.)

Welcome to Debian GNU/Linux:

* Your hostname is "syracuse".
* Your username is "archimedes".
* Your (and the root) password is "hamster".

The best place to start is to double-click the "Terminal - LXTerminal" icon.

The prompt you'll be greeted with is canonical:

----
archimedes@syracuse:~$
----

Throughout the remainder of this course, we won't mention any archimedes at
syracuse, and just state the working directory, when necessary.

Happy hacking :-)

=== Troubleshooting

1. *Black background, no icons on the desktop.* This typically happens if you
shut down the machine in an improper way, i.e. not using the graphical user
interface.

=== Working with Directories

If you are completely new to working with Linux follow this short guide to get
started with working with directories.

Start up LXTerminal.

Create a directory, `test`, in our home (`~`) directory:

----
~$ mkdir test
----

To change the current working directory, use the `cd` command:

----
~$ cd test
~/test$ 
----

To go one level up in the directory structure, use `..` as the destination
argument.

----
~/test$ cd ..
~$ 
----

We can use `ls` to list the contents of a directory:

----
~$ ls
Desktop   osm   test
~$
----

=== Setting up Shared Folders

If you find it obscure to work inside the VirtualBox, and instead want to use
your favourite OS X, Windows, or FreeBSD editor, you can set up a shared folder
between your host operating system and the guest virtual machine.

1. Select the "osm16-v1.0" OS and press "Settings".

2. Select the "Shared Folders" tab on the left-hand side of the popped up
window.

3. Click on the little folder with a plus on the right-hand side of the window
to add a new Shared folder.

4. Select a path on your host machine as the "Folder Path".

5. To avoid a myriad of possible problems, let "Folder Name" be some name
without spaces. For instance, "osm16-sf", standing for osm16 shared folder.

6. Select "Auto-mount".

7. Click "OK".

8. (Re)start the virtual machine.

9. You will find the folder you shared under `/media/sf_${NAME}`, where
`${NAME}` with the "Folder Name" from before.

10. Optional: To quickly find `/media/sf_${NAME}/` you might want to add a soft
link to this folder from your Desktop.

  a. Open LXTerminal.

  b. Enter the command `ln -s /media/sf_${NAME}/ ~/Desktop/${NAME}`, where you
should use the "Folder Name" from before in place of `${NAME}`.

  c. Close LXTerminal, and check that the link has appeared on the desktop, and
works.

=== Working with the VM via SSH

Working with a desktop environment can be cumbersome, especially if you already
set up the shared folders above.

You can start up the virtual machine in so-called "headless mode" i.e. without
an interface with the desktop environment, and work with the virtual machine
exclusively from the command line.

If you are using the VirtualBox GUI to manage your virtual machine, hold down
*Shift* when you press *Start* to start the virtual machine in headless mode.

While the machine is running, you can use SSH (on Windows, you can use
http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe[PuTTY]) to connect to
the virtual machine. Connect to *localhost* on port *3022*, with the user
*archimedes* and password *hamster*.

[TIP]
====
If you don't want to start up the VirtualBox GUI to start a virtual machine in
headless mode, you can use the following command: `vboxmanage startvm osm16-v1.0
--type headless`.

To shutdown the machine, use `sudo shutdown -h now` while logged in via SSH.
